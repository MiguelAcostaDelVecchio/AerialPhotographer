## Description
I was the lead of my Senior Design Project at Temple University. The purpose of this project was to build a drone using our electrical and mechanical engineering knowledge (3 Electrical Engineers and 1 Mechanical Engineer) to create a drone capable of pre-recorded flight plans and intelligent features such as object detection and classification using the opencv library in python.

## Details
To begin this project, we had to determine which components to buy which had to be both cheap and could work together given our technical requirements for the drone. After determining the tradeoffs, implementability, and synergy of the components. We had to assemble the drone. Here is a video of how I assembled the drone.
